# EgoAction-Egocentric-based-Construction-Worker-Action-Recognition-
EgoAction is a real-world construction action recognition dataset built upon the Ego4D framework. It focuses on fine-grained construction worker actions captured from an egocentric perspective. Current action categories include welding, drilling, nailing, smoothing, and applying concrete. Additional actions will be released in future updates!

The dataset currently provides egocentric images and will include hand pose annotations as well as object-level annotations, including bounding boxes and labels for construction tools in future releases.
